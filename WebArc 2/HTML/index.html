        <h2>St. George - A Haiku</h2>
            <p1>I was inspired to write this after a fun weekend in St. George.</p>
            <p1>We Left to St. George,<br>We played lots of pickle ball,<br>Tomorrow I work.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>In this paragraph I will talk about my love for apple products. I have been interested in them since they were first being developed. My friend got one for christmas in 5th grade and since then I have always been intrigued by them. They have changed so much since then and I'm sure they will continue to change even more.</p>
        <p>Next I will talk about my interest in film. I love to discover new techniques on how to improve filming with drones. I have had several models and find it very fun to fly around and record landscape shots. Some pilots are very skilled and I want to improve, so I can film cool shots like them.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I will talk about my interest in cooking. Food is such a social thing and can be very fun to share with others. I love finding new things to cook for friends and family. (when I have the money of course) One of my favorite dishes to make is chicken adobo, a dish made in the Philippines where I served a mission.</p>
